            <h2 class="title-small">Hi there!</h2>
            <p>My name is Jean-Simon Robert Ouimet. I am an independent thinker seeking innovative solutions to complex problems. I have a flair for creating memorable visual identities, impactful marketing material, and elegant user interfaces. My work has been praised for both its originality and clarity. I know my way around most design software, but I also like to use good old pen and paper to quickly assess the value of an idea. My strong desire to understand how things work under the hood also led me to develop a good understanding of web development. Over the years, I have worked with a variety of frameworks and libraries, both front-end and back-end.</p>
            <p>Working as a professional musician for more than ten years taught me that the most valuable things in life can only be achieved through dedication, and it is in the same spirit that I approach my work as a designer today. I love to be surrounded by smart, yet humble people, and I will do everything I can to help them leverage their strengths in an effort to materialize a vision.</p>
            <p>My mother tongue is French and I am proudly bilingual.</p>
